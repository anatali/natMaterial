<h2>HL7 version 3</h2>
 <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186" target="web">HL7 Version 3 Product Suite</a>.<br/>
 
 The Version 3 Normative Edition represents a new approach to clinical information exchange based on a <em>model driven methodology</em> 
 that produces messages and electronic documents expressed in <tt>XML syntax</tt>. <br/><br/>
 The V3 specification is built around <em>subject domains</em> that provide 
 storyboard descriptions, trigger events, interaction designs, domain object models derived from the 
  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=77" target="web">HL7 Version 3: Reference Information Model (<em>RIM</em>)</a>, 
 hierarchical message descriptors (HMDs) and a prose description of each element. <br/><br/>
 Implementation of these domains further depends upon a non-normative V3 Guide and normative specifications for: 
 data types; the XML technical specifications (ITS) or message wire format; message and control "wrappers", and transport protocols.
 
 
 <h2>FHIR</h2>
 <k>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</k> (<a href="https://fhir.org/" target="web"><em>FHIR</em></a>, pronounced "fire") 
 is a standard describing data formats and elements (known as "resources") 
 and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records 
 (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=269" target="web"><em>EHR</em></a>). 
 The standard was created by the Health Level Seven International (HL7) health-care standards organization.<br/><br/>

 There are some HL7 version 3 based projects that don't have a published set of MIFs - they only have normative XML schema.
